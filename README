This is Perspex.

It enables the projection of arbitrary 3D points to a 2D space - and has helper functions for offscreen and backface polygon culling (soon, view frustum culling.)

The demo shows you what's possible. Documentation coming. Code cleanup coming. Sorry.

Note: The demo deliberately collides objects to test depth sorting and (in future) occlusion culling. This is not a bug. Up the geometry resolution to (kill your computer) and see it work a little more nicely.
